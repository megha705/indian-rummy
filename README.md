# indian-rummy [WIP]

Indian Rummy card game in Java. This is a fun pet project, I am making in order to learn JavaFX and Java network programming concepts.

## How much I have progressed until now?

Until now the game can display 13 cards in a row which can be moved horizontally only using mouse. A lot of work to do. You can see the project kanban board. I will try to keep it updated. 

## Motivation

I was thinking of a project for which I had to use JavaFX and Java networking concepts. Upon some thinking I finalised with building multilpayer Indian Rummy. I played Indian Rummy a lot during the summer vacation of 2018. I played it with my friends in the evening. 

I am aware that android games of Indian Rummy are available in play store so why make it? 

I like to build things from scratch because that is best way to learn about that technology or programming language. Comptuer games always push the boundaries of programming.
